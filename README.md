# SSIProject
 This social service internship project for an NGO aims to create a wearable band for senior citizen patients. When a patient visits the hospital, the doctor diagnoses them and enters all pertinent information into the system. Subsequently, a QR code is generated for the patient and printed onto the wearable band.
